    </p>

    <h3><span>MVP</span></h3>
    <p>The app should allow the user to create, edit and remove teams in the league <br>
        The user should be able to create new games<br>
        There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game<br>
        The app should display if a game was won or lost
    </p>

    <h3><span>Extensions (Possible)</span></h3>
    <p>
        Create a league table to see who is on top of the league <br>
        Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.) <br>
